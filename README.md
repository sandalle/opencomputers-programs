# ae2/combine-enchanted-books/
This script will scan through the connected Applied Energistics ME storage for duplicate low-tier Enchanted Books and then send them as output in pairs through a connected Anvil or MFR Auto-Anvil (or really whatever device you tell it to send the books through) to combine them.

## Example
Your ME network has two Protection I Enchanted Books. This script will send them as output to be merged as Protection II.
